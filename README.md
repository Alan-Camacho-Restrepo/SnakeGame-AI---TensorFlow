# Teach AI to Play Snake with algorithms of Reinforcement Learning with tensorflow. 
To create a snake environment I use gym library, to get states, actions and so on of the agent to train with the models. Leading me from https://github.com/AleksaC/gym-snake  (in this repository Aleksa create a gym-environment to snake game) I modified this snake environment code to change the state shape and to getting easy to train. 
To learn and get better skills of reinforcement learning, I took the course https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction? especially the course "Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning" and from here I used various algorithms and the structures of the model in tensorflow.
